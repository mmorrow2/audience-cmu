## Week 1

What an exciting start to my LAST mini of graduate school! 

## Week 2

Week 2 was a combination of Third Place Theory and Arc of Engagement Theory. 
I had a difficult time fully understanding the idea of Third Place, because I was thinking of my own experiences. I find my third places to be two different restaurants in East Liberty, but that does not that mean they are Third Places for everyone. Once we did more discussions in class, I became to recognize more elements that define an actual third space. Here is a snapshot of some of the things me and my partner came up with during a class exercise:

The biggest theme that I noticed from other groups is the idea of being low cost, or at least cost that is worth the space. An example I thought of:
Everyone knows a cup of coffee from Starbucks is deemed "expensive." However, as a third space, I often consider the cost of that coffee to be worth it because I can relax with my friends for hours if I wanted. I know that no one is going to kick me out, even after I have thrown my coffee away. 
When I was in college, I went to a hotel in the city square for the free wifi. I didn't buy anything. I didn't stay at the hotel. I did work (so it was a little more of a fourth place) but I often saw people just come in to socialize. And when I didn't have work, I still went there to grab a drink from their bar and relax with my friends.

This thought really helped me put third spaces into clarity. I also found that the separation I feel from art places is based on numerous factors that contribute to third space. For example, I have never entered a theatre space and felt it to be a third space, because it is always work for me. Museums are unique in that I feel like I have to be quiet and to keep moving. I would love to see more lounge-type areas not only before/after a show, but even when there is not a show running. This could open the doors for really connection with the community, without the pressure of time surroundng the experience.
