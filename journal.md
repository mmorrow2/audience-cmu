## Week 1
### Digital Liveness

What an exciting start to my LAST mini of graduate school! I can already tell I am going to enjoy this class very much.
Something I want to touch on more is the idea of "liveness." The class exercise where we created a scale of where certain items falls was actually really difficult, and I was still thinking about it even afterward because of how different every one else's answers were. We use our own experiences to help determine this scale, and everyone has different experiences. It doesn't help that the theory of liveness is not cut-and-dry, that it is a spectrum.

## Week 2
### Third Place and Arc of Engagement Theory

I had a difficult time fully understanding the idea of Third Place, because I was thinking of my own experiences. I find my third places to be two different restaurants in East Liberty, but that does not that mean they are Third Places for everyone. Once we did more discussions in class, I became to recognize more elements that define an actual third space. Here is a snapshot of some of the things me and my partner came up with during a class exercise:

The biggest theme that I noticed from other groups is the idea of being low cost, or at least cost that is worth the space. An example I thought of:
Everyone knows a cup of coffee from Starbucks is deemed "expensive." However, as a third space, I often consider the cost of that coffee to be worth it because I can relax with my friends for hours if I wanted. I know that no one is going to kick me out, even after I have thrown my coffee away. 
When I was in college, I went to a hotel in the city square for the free wifi. I didn't buy anything. I didn't stay at the hotel. I did work (so it was a little more of a fourth place) but I often saw people just come in to socialize. And when I didn't have work, I still went there to grab a drink from their bar and relax with my friends.

This thought really helped me put third spaces into clarity. I also found that the separation I feel from art places is based on numerous factors that contribute to third space. For example, I have never entered a theatre space and felt it to be a third space, because it is always work for me. Museums are unique in that I feel like I have to be quiet and to keep moving. I would love to see more lounge-type areas not only before/after a show, but even when there is not a show running. This could open the doors for really connection with the community, without the pressure of time surroundng the experience.

The second topic we talked about was the Arc of Engagement. Here's a handy picture of it for reference.

Something I wanted to cirlce back to was the hypothesis that was posed on whether or not the arc is different for patrons for popular vs. traditional forms of art. I think it is different. And the main example I have as evidence is digital art and public art. There is not a "build up" or "intense preparation" phase, especially when you are just scrolling through social media or walking around. There is still the middle to end of the arc, but no front end.

## Week 3
### Experience Economy

So, I want Michele to be my best friend. She exudes so much energy and happiness and rainbows- anyway, I loved having her in class. She was a joy, and it was fascinating to see what we were learning in class directly applied to an arts organization, from someone actually running the organization. Her entire workshop and the "Some Assembly Required" performances are so engaging, and really brings out the power of what can happen when people are invited to engage with the art outside of what they are used to. Actually, I plan on talking with her and seeing if I can adapt the workshop we did in class for my own uses in my pageant world, because it is such a powerful tool. 
We also talked about the Experience Economy this week, and that was a fascinating topic to read about. It's interesting to see how things have evolved over the years as society has progressed with technology and other social progressions. The reading also started off with an annecdote about cake, so I was instantly hooked. Anyway, like Chris, I also thought of Meow Wolf when trying to put the Realms of Experience into context. Meow Wolf is an example of an organization that fits in the "escapist" quadrant of this graph:

Something like going to the movies or to a musical would fall into "entertainment," going to a museum would fall into "educational," and something like the traveling Candytopia exhibit would be "esthetic." The four poles are ranges of how people choose to engage, and how the organizations I listed traditionally invited that engagement. 

## Week 4
### Experience Economy

This week we only had one class due to Carnival, but we did have time to wrap up discussions based on the Experience Economy. I really enjoyed how we were able to expand upon the theory to include the present and how it manifests now. I really like being able to talk about front-facing people in organizations, and how organizations really should pay more attention to their training. I know that most ushers are volunteers, but they are still spokespeople for your organization. They should not be missed when it comes to conveying the mission and values of your organization. There is a story that I remember Brett telling us in another class, and its that when she worked at a theatre (I think it was Imagination Stage), someone comented that every person who worked there seemed happy and like they wanted to be there. That should be the norm. Every time someone walks into the museum, into the theatre, into the concert hall, they should be greeted by people who are HAPPY TO BE THERE! 
In addition, I'm glad to see the push for "omnichannel" touchpoints. I think a lot of organizations are too narrow in their scope of who they can partner with in terms of advertising their season or extra tickets for their show. I can see myself really pushing these concepts in future posistions I work in because it is so, so important.

## Week 5 
### Immersion and UXD



## Week 6
### Immersion and Relevancy

We started off the week with a wonderful guest speaker, Carrie Boyd, from Emursive. They are the presenters of [Sleep No More](https://mckittrickhotel.com/sleep-no-more/#/) in New York, and I had so. many. questions. to ask of her. I really tried to bring in everything we had learned from this class and from previous ones in asking her questions- I ended up being the one who talked the most, but I was so fascinated by everything she had to say and how the entire process came to be. I found it interesting that they have very strict NDAs, but it makes sense since they are a for-profit theatre company. I also found it interesting that they don't use union workers, even for their designers. I am always a little hesitant when it comes to companies who don't use union members, but I also understand that it can sometimes be for the better, and the fact that there is not really a union for dancers makes it more understandable. 
For the I really enjoyed being able to dust off the "Art of Relevancy" book that we are reading. I had picked it up for free at WQED when I worked with Steeltown, and looking back, I find it incredibly ironic that it was there, because that is an institution that wouldn't know relevancy if it hit them in the face. Anyway, like I said, I am grateful for the opportunity.
First, I am going to link Nina Simon's TEDx talk here so I can have it for reference: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTih-l739w4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTih-l739w4)
My biggest takeaway was the idea of the "insiders" versus "outsiders" and how that manifested into doors and keys.

## Week 7
A lot of my takeways from both the lecture and from our guest speaker was the importance of evaluation.
