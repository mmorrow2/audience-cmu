- "a focus on providing gathering and community-focused spaces outside the theatre itself, in public lobbies, community rooms, cafés, and restaurants open all day regardless of the production schedule."
- TheatreSquared in Fayetteville Arkansas did exactly this by creating a "commons" area that was specifically made for people to gather. 
- "Open Your Lobby" Campaigns during the Pandemic to give people safe places to go-- people view arts organizations as safe spaces, it is time to start making them fully Third Spaces.
- St. Ann'e Warehouse: they decided that their space would reach those by transforming the exterior. They put art on the walls and they put music on the roof, which honestly invites me in a lot more than some other organizations have. 
- "Institutions must be poised to assume ever-expanding missions, and these will affect both the way they design new facilities and how they operate."
- Being an inviting space that is solely there for people to congregate and talk to each other is not always a priority, but these examples have shown how impactful it can be.

- This article has a section on agency, and that is the element of Meow Wolf that plays heavily into the idea that it could operate as an example of a third space.
- "Meow Wolf attractions succeed because they create environments that allow for people to follow their whims. There are no maps, no clear instructions on what to do. Just explore and discover on your own terms. That’s it." There is no expectation to do anything a certain way. Also, you could go through numerous times and never really see the same thing twice.

- Critical writing makes the Post-processing and impact echo sections longer due to the nature of critical writing. You have to think deeply about something, you're more likely to remember it. 
- People who try to engage beforehand (in the build up or intense preparation stages) have much more information about the experience from these audience critics, and are more likely to have a deeper artistic exchange because they had some background knowledge. 
- Also gives a new place to engage with the organization itself
