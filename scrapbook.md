## Third Place

### Get Past the Lobby: Theatres Rethink How We Gather
[Link to article](https://drive.google.com/file/d/14Z9HuQU5j1esl1BAPhu2-sBgRxZrKEud/view)
- "A focus on providing gathering and community-focused spaces outside the theatre itself, in public lobbies, community rooms, cafés, and restaurants open all day regardless of the production schedule." This is the exact foundation needed for a third space. Recognizing that communities need to feel safe coming somewhere, without expectation, is vital to creating a place that fosters communications and has "regulars."
- TheatreSquared in Fayetteville Arkansas did exactly this by creating a "commons" area that was specifically made for people to gather. I like that they were able to ceate this space in their theatre, because it gives other theatres something to look at in terms of how to take that next step. Granted, this particular project took a lot of time and money, but they had a very clear vision on what they wanted and what they hoped to achieve. 
- "Open Your Lobby" Campaigns during the Pandemic gave people safe places to go-- people view arts organizations as safe spaces, it is time to start making them fully Third Spaces. This is an element that I hope to utilize in my own career. Even if the place I end up working cannot afford a renovation to create a common space, they can still open their lobbys with chairs and tables and other relaxed seating that is open to the public even when a show is not running. 
- St. Ann'e Warehouse: they decided that their space would reach those by transforming the exterior. They put art on the walls and they put music on the roof, which honestly invites me in a lot more than some other organizations have. Transforming the roof is something that I will also take with me. If it's a place that people can go that allows them to simply sit and experience something joyful, they will be more willing to come back and actually participate in what the organization provides. 
- "Institutions must be poised to assume ever-expanding missions, and these will affect both the way they design new facilities and how they operate."
- Being an inviting space that is solely there for people to congregate and talk to each other is not always a priority, but these examples have shown how impactful it can be.

### How Meow Wolf Powers Exploration and Discovery
[Link to article](https://info.hotelspacesevent.com/blog/how-meow-wolf-powers-exploration-and-discovery)
- This article has a section on agency, and that is the element of Meow Wolf that plays heavily into the idea that it could operate as an example of a third space. Since people are able to walk around at their leisure, explore at their own will, stop and talk and engage with something or someone whenever they feel like it. 
- "Meow Wolf attractions succeed because they create environments that allow for people to follow their whims. There are no maps, no clear instructions on what to do. Just explore and discover on your own terms. That’s it." There is no expectation to do anything a certain way. Also, you could go through numerous times and never really see the same thing twice, which could bring in "regulars." 
- Having the ability to have a unique experience for each person, and allow them to find their own journey through something is an element of this that I will be taking with me when thinking about the creation of third places in my career. 

### Using Interactive Activities to Enhance Engagement
[Link to article](https://galachoruses.org/sites/default/files/Barun-Making_Sense_of_Audience_Engagement.pdf) Page 73
- In this particular case study, there is a lot in interactivity between the audience and the art. There are low-tech elements for people to come and explore with, allowing for people of all cognitive abilities to be able to engage with. In addition, there were Q&A sessions with the artists, allowing for a more "behind the scenes" look at the process of the art creation. 
- By having these open conversations with the artist (even negative feedback was welcolmed in these sessions) it allowed for real conversation to take space, which is an element of a third space. 
- Not censoring the audience's feedback, questions, or comments is something I want to take with me in my future career. It will allow people the space to truly explore art for all it has to give, and not just what it is being curated as. 

## Arc of Engagement

### Nurturing Citizen Critics to Engage Audiences
[Link to article](https://galachoruses.org/sites/default/files/Barun-Making_Sense_of_Audience_Engagement.pdf) Page 54
- Critical writing makes the Post-processing and impact echo sections longer due to the nature of critical writing. You have to think deeply about something, you're more likely to remember it. 
- People who try to engage beforehand (in the build up or intense preparation stages) have much more information about the experience from these audience critics, and are more likely to have a deeper artistic exchange because they had some background knowledge. 
- Also gives a new place to engage with the organization itself

### How the Pandemic Changed Museums Forever (or Did It?)
[Link to article](https://news.usc.edu/trojan-family/virtual-art-museum-tours-exhibitions-after-covid-pandemic/)
- A reminder that web engagement is still engagement, and goes through a very similar process
- People who engage with art and media on the internet might have a very short front-end arc (like if they stumble upon an art video on TikTok that thy weren't expecting) or it could follow the same arc (like if they are watching a livestream of an orchestral performance.) However, what is important to note about this particular case study is that even if the experience is digital, it is still valid.
- Digital engagement has grown exponentially over the course of the pandemic, and it has increased the accessibility of a lot of arts organizations as well. Moving forward, I hope to remind organizations that even though going digital may not be a "have to" anymore, it is definitely a "should do" and that our digital audience deserves as much attention as our in-person audience gets. Their expereince, while different, is not less important. 


## Experience

### A High Touch Theatrical Experience for a High Tech World

- In the experience realm matrix, this particular case study fits into all of them, with a little more leaning towards the educational realm. This is mostly due to the fact that a large basis for the platform that was created is meant to be populated by people who had viewed the show, for those who have not, to garner more interest. 
- It's a great concept to use because even if someone did not like the show and they put out a bad review, that actually might have the opposite affect and could bring in people who are curious. I am a firm believer that your audience should not be censored. 

### A Bold Experiment in Digital Theatre With Google+
[Link to Article](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Vta9tXo4CKLtxvOREZFf9Hon97taqTFw/view)
- Something that has not really been explored much in this class is the idea of partnerships between organizations and how that can affect a user's experience. However, with this case study, I think there was more information on what could come of a partnership. Despite it being online and through a technology company, the overall appeal of being able to use Google to create art brought in a unique set of audience members. There was a range of the level of experience someone had with using Google+, so that was a hurdle, but the overall idea and execution was quite interesting. I think using the idea to partner with organizations and companies that are outside of the arts to find new audiences is a great tool to keep.
- This experience seems to fall on the experience realm matrix in a variety of ways, depending on who the user is. Audience members had the option to participate passively by absorbing the content generated by RSC, or they could actively participate. Immersion and absorption were both present with help from the digital experience, as much as they could be without being in an actual curated space.

## Immersion

### Entrepeneurs Bet Big on Immersive Art Despite COVID-19

- This case study talks about how despite the COVID pandemic, people are still investing in art installations and museums that prioritze immersion. Examples like the "Rain Room" and Meow Wolf are given, and it is easy to see why people are still wanting to go to these places and why investors are willing to risk their assets to create more of it: People love new experiences. Take the "Rain Room" - being able to walk into a room, that's raining, yet everywhere you step, it stops above you. It's incredible. You can smell, feel, hear, see, and even taste the water that is completely surrounding you. 
- For a space like Meow Wolf where you are encouraged to break the norms of traditonal musuems and actually TOUCH things, it is incredibly exciting. Added on to the fact that there is a mystery surrounding the museum, it becomes an engagement that is not easily forgotten or replicated. 
- One of the main things to take away from this case study is that art museums and other immersive experiences should really look to the people who are in their community, and not just tourists. The people who live in your town, or your county, want to experience art and culture just as much as the people who are visiting. But, it is up to us to remind them that we are here. 

### Immersive theatres changing how we experience film

- This has a lot to do with trying to get the audience to come be a part of the process of making art, instead of just experiencing the finished product. It is a very fine line to walk down, because some people do not want to see the process, they are content with not knowing the details of how something was made. Some people like the mystery, while others want to dive deep and learn everything they can about a piece of art they are seeing. I think it is important to remember that not everyone is interested in the new ideas that can be presented.

## Relevancy

### Made in L.A. 2020 from the Hammer Museum of Art
[Link to Website](https://hammer.ucla.edu/exhibitions/2021/made-la-2020-version)
- I brought this particuar case study into my toolkit because I found it interesting how the curators of this biennial exhibit had two different exhibits that mirrored each other in two different locations. The exhibit, "Made In LA" was a celebration of Los Angeles artists and the Hammer Museum of Art partnered with the Huntington Library to have a larger impact.
- The Hammer Museum is in Los Angeles, close to the Beverly Hill neighborhood, and down the street from the Getty Museum. The Huntington Library, Art Gallery, and Botanical Gardens is 30 minutes East in Pasadena. They have a very different set of audience members. However, with this particular show, they are showcasing artists who are from, live, and work in Los Angeles and the surrounding neighborhoods. By expanding the reach and going to a different venue, they are actively inviting more people to come in and see what they normally do in their museum. 
- I think the mirrored exhibits is an awesome idea, because I would want to go to both rooms to see how they differ and how they are the same. I plan on using that idea because it means that people are more likly to want to see the full exhibit if there is an obvious connection. 

### 24th Street Theatre
[Link to Article](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1w7tSIm7fa6bMNosJHJcpRh2459jdb3Qq/view) Page 16
- This theatre opened doors by bringing theatre to low-income adults who would not otherwise be able to pay for acting classes or be able to purchase a ticket to a show. By taking the time to meet with them and create an entire play together, they brought in relevancy. 24th Street Theatre was willing to meet their "outsiders" where they were, especially when they met hardships since these were working class adults and not professional actors. 
- Engaing the community is important. However, being able to follow through and not give up when things do not go as planned is how to actually build a community.
